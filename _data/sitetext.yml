    title: "About Me"
    text: "My story"
    body: "Whenever I wanted to build something, repair something or experiment on something...I always found myself lacking, not the idea but the tools and hardware required. I like programming cause when I code, it's just me, my idea and my computer. Nothing to stop me, nothing can stop me. Atmost what I will need would be some aftermarket plugins, libraries, API which are effectively few clicks away. "
