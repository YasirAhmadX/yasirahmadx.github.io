**Rock Paper Scissor** is an adaptation of **MENACE** (Machine Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine) of Donald Michie. It was a simple matchbox computer that used beads to alter
the probability of wining or losing by means of reward and punishment. In modern ML, this is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm called **Q-Learning Algorithm**.
